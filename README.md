MusicaLibre is a Linux Music player and local audio files manager using a sqlite database for fast operations.
Features:
- Play tracks, Play next or Append tracks groups to the now playing list.
- Group tracks by album, genre, artist, year, playlist, publisher, even codec. All of that and more is possible
- Same goes for sorting.
- Search and filter by name.
- Manage most commonly used metadata tags directly in app. Custom tags not supported.
- Manage embedded audio files artwork
- Like Calibre for books, or Musicbee, you can send managed audio files and playlists to your external usb devices (phone, mp3 player)
- Save your playlist to m3u.
- Built with Avalonia so it doesn't care whether your Window manager dislikes Qt or GTK.

Dependencies:
- Uses VLC libraries for playback.
